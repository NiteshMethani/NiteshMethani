# Nitesh Methani 👋

Hello, my name is Nitesh.

Currently I am working as an Applied Scientist-II at Amazon where me and my team leverage LLMs and GenAI to improve the last mile delivery experience for our customers.

I am currently working on core Geospatial use cases like Address Standardization and Validation, Parsing and Matching.

In June 2020, I graduated from IIT, Madras specialising in Deep Learning and VQA models.

I have published papers in top-tier ML conferences like WACV, AAAI, Sigspatial as well as AMLC (Amazon's internal conference).

Currently, I am focusing in the area of NLP and multi-modal models like CLIP and ViLBERT to generate business value.
